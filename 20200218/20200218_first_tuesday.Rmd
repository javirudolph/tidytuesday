# Get the Data
```{r message = FALSE}

food_consumption <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/food_consumption.csv')

```




```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the libraries and if you don't have them installed yet
# install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}
# Check how the data looks

food_consumption %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = consumption, y = co2_emmission, color = food_category)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_classic() +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Food"))
  #scale_color_viridis_d() +
  #guide_legend(color = "Food") +

```

How many countries do we have? The data shows we have `r length(unique(food_consumption$country))` countries and `r length(unique(food_consumption$food_category))` food categories.
